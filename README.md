Skeleton application to send messages over missed calls.

To install and run the application.
First of all clone the repository into your local machine.
Then install Android Studio.
In Android Studio import this directory as a project. (It should automatically identify this as an android studio project.)
Connect your android device and just install it.

The file MainActivity.java contains the code for the application.
This version of application tailored to facilitate the measurement process, this includes generation of files that log timestamps,
hardcoded strings that the application sends, and hardcoded parameters such as Interstate Difference and so on. So its highly
recommended that you go over the base implementation first before you start extending the code base.
